## ⚙️ Configuration

### Adjustable Thresholds

```cpp
// Water Level Thresholds (0-1023)
#define WATER_LOW_TH       500   // Increase if too sensitive
#define WATER_HIGH_TH      650   // Adjust for overflow detection

// Water Quality
#define TURB_DIRTY_TH      600   // Lower = more sensitive to dirt

// Rain Detection
#define RAIN_WET_TH        500   // Adjust based on sensor

// Object Detection
#define DETECT_CM          20    // Maximum detection distance (cm)
```

### Motor Speed Settings

```cpp
// Conveyor Speed (0-255)
#define CONV_SPEED         145   // Adjust for optimal debris removal

// Wiper Speed
const int WIPER_SPEED = 40;      // Lower = slower cleaning
```

### Timing Parameters

```cpp
// Conveyor Run Time
#define MOTOR_RUN_MS       5000UL   // Milliseconds per cycle

// Wiper Cycle
const unsigned long WIPER_OFF_TIME = 2000UL;  // OFF duration (ms)
const unsigned long WIPER_ON_TIME  = 300UL;   // ON duration (ms)

// Metal Detection Latch
const unsigned long METAL_LATCH_MS = 800UL;   // Stabilization time

// Blockage Detection Window
const unsigned long BLOCKAGE_TIME = 15000UL;  // 15 seconds
```

### Monitoring Interval

```cpp
#define PRINT_EVERY_MS     10000UL  // Serial output frequency
```

## 🔄 How It Works

### Normal Operation Flow

1. **System Initialization**
   ```
   → All sensors initialized
   → Motors set to safe defaults
   → Wiper cycle starts immediately
   → Servo positioned at 90° (neutral)
   ```

2. **Continuous Monitoring Loop**
   ```
   → Read all sensor values
   → Process ultrasonic detection
   → Check metal detector
   → Monitor water levels
   → Assess turbidity
   → Detect rainfall
   → Calculate blockage risk
   ```

3. **Automated Responses**

   **Object Detected:**
   ```
   IF ultrasonic detects object within 20cm
   AND conveyor not already running
   THEN
     → Start conveyor motor (speed 145)
     → Run for 5 seconds
     → Automatic stop
     → Reset latch
   ```

   **Metal Detected:**
   ```
   IF metal detector triggered
   THEN
     → Activate 800ms latch
     → Rotate servo to 20°
     → Hold position during latch
     → Return to 90° when latch expires
   ```

   **Blockage Detected:**
   ```
   IF rain detected AND water present
   AND condition persists for 15 seconds
   THEN
     IF high water sensor triggered
       → SEVERE BLOCKAGE alert
     ELSE
       → PARTIAL BLOCKAGE alert
   ```

4. **Maintenance Operations**
   ```
   Wiper Cycle (continuous):
   → ON for 300ms (cleaning)
   → OFF for 2000ms (waiting)
   → Repeat indefinitely
   ```

### Blockage Detection Algorithm

```
Time Window: 15 seconds
Trigger Conditions: Rain + Water Low Level OK

Evaluation:
├─ Water High Level OK
│  └─ Result: SEVERE BLOCKAGE 🚨
│     (Water rising/overflow detected)
│
├─ Water High Level NOT OK
│  └─ Result: PARTIAL BLOCKAGE ⚠️
│     (Rain present but water not rising normally)
│
└─ Either condition false
   └─ Result: NORMAL FLOW ✅
      (System operating normally)
```

### Serial Output Format

Every 10 seconds, the system prints:
```
==============================
SENSOR READINGS + DECISIONS

Water Low  (A0): 645  => OK
Water High (A3): 423  => LOW
Turbidity  (A1): 789  => DIRTY
Rain (A2): 678  => WET
Metal DO (D36 raw): 1  => NO METAL
Ultrasonic (37/38): 15 cm  => OBJECT DETECTED
Conveyor Motor: RUNNING (3s left)
Wiper Motor: ON (wiping)
Wiper PWM Speed: 40
✅ WATER FLOW NORMAL
==============================
```

## 🎯 Threshold Tuning

### Water Level Sensors

**Calibration Process:**
```
1. Place sensor in completely dry environment
   → Note the reading (baseline)
2. Gradually submerge in water
   → Record readings at different depths
3. Identify reliable trigger points
4. Set thresholds with 10% safety margin
```

**Recommended Settings:**
- **Low sensor**: Set threshold where consistent water presence starts
- **High sensor**: Set threshold before overflow point

### Turbidity Sensor

**Calibration Process:**
```
1. Test with clean, clear water
   → Record baseline (should be low value)
2. Add dirt/sediment gradually
   → Note when water becomes visibly cloudy
3. Set threshold at noticeable cloudiness point
```

### Rain Sensor

**Calibration Process:**
```
1. Dry condition test
   → Note reading (high value typically)
2. Spray with water
   → Record wet reading (low value typically)
3. Set threshold between dry and wet states
```

### Ultrasonic Sensor

**Calibration Process:**
```
1. Test detection range with various objects
2. Adjust DETECT_CM based on drain width
3. Consider: Smaller value = more precise
4. Typical range: 10-30cm
```

### Tips for Tuning

- **Start conservative**: Use higher thresholds and reduce if needed
- **Environmental factors**: Temperature affects sensors
- **Regular recalibration**: Monthly checks recommended
- **Document settings**: Keep log of working thresholds
- **Test edge cases**: Extreme conditions (heavy rain, full blockage)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Conveyor Motor Not Starting

**Symptoms**: Object detected but motor doesn't run

**Solutions**:
1. Check power supply to L298N driver
2. Verify pin connections (EN, IN1, IN2)
3. Test with higher CONV_SPEED value
4. Check motor connections and polarity
5. Ensure conveyor isn't already running

### Metal Detection Unreliable

**Symptoms**: False positives or missed detections

**Solutions**:
1. Verify INPUT_PULLUP is set correctly

3. Adjust METAL_LATCH_MS (increase for stability)
4. Ensure metal detector has proper power
5. Test with different metal objects
6. Check for electromagnetic interference

### Wiper Motor Issues

**Symptoms**: Wiper doesn't move or moves erratically

**Solutions**:

2. Recalibrate water level sensors
3. Verify rain sensor isn't giving false positives
4. Check water sensor placement
5. Adjust threshold values

### Serial Monitor Shows Garbage

### System Resets Unexpectedly

**Symptoms**: Arduino reboots during operation

**Solutions**:
1. **Power issue** (most common):
   - Use external power supply for motors
